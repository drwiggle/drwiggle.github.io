          <p> I'm recently transitioned from academia to industry; I'm currently employed as a data scientist for Progressive Leasing, a fintech company based in Utah.  I've been coding in Python for several years as part of my research and in personal projects; I've also utilized iPython/Jupyter notebooks in the classroom as a pedagogical tool.  Here is my industry <a href="resume.pdf">resume</a>.
          </p>
          
          <p>Until recently, I was a Visiting Assistant Professor at the University of Arkansas working with the
           <a href="https://mattclay.hosted.uark.edu/TopologySeminar/">topology group</a>, where I taught undergraduate math classes and performed research in the field of geometric group theory (see below for details).  Prior to my stint at the University of Arkansas, I worked with
           <a href="http://www.math.ou.edu/~jing/">Jing Tao</a> as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the
           <a href="http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/">Fields Institute</a> in Toronto for the Thematic Program
           on Teichmuller Theory and its Connections to Geometry, Topology, and Dynamics.  I completed my PhD at
           the University of Utah under the direction of <a href="http://math.utah.edu/~bestvina/">Mladen Bestvina</a>.
           </p>

           <p>
             Most of my research is in the field of geometric group theory, a subject that aims to understand groups using tools from geometry, topology, and dynamics.  I have focused  especially on free groups and their automorphisms, which can be understood as self maps of finite graphs.  Please follow the links to <a href="#research">research</a> for more information and for a list of publications.
           </p>

          <p>
            I am passionate about mathematics education and love tinkering with new pedagogical tools.  My recent classes have utilized a "flipped classroom" model of instruction paired with mastery based grading.  I'm always excited to try new things in an effort to maximize student engagement and learning.  I have led one-on-one reading courses with undergraduates in Arkansas.  Please follow the link to <a href="#teaching">teaching</a> for sample materials and information coming from these experiences.

                            <h4> Mastery-Based Grading</h4>
                        I have recently implemented "mastery-based grading" in my classes.  One of the primary goals of this grading system is to produce grades that more accurately reflect a student’s learning progress and achievement.  This is especially relevant in situations where students struggled early on in a semester or school year, but then put in the effort and hard work needed to meet expected standards.
                        </p>

                        <p>In my classroom, there are no points and there are no weighted percentages to calculate final grades.  Grades are earned by achieving a sufficient number of Satisfactory marks on various assignments, and by engaging with the course.  Almost every assessment is graded Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (or Pass/Fail), and students have many opportunities to show proficiency on almost all of these assessments.  I'm really passionate about new and innovative ways of teaching, and I have been quite pleased with my experiences with SBG.  If you'd like more information on how this has been implemented in my classroom, take a look at <a href="files/2020DiscreteCurriculum.pdf"> these slides.</a>  If you have any further questions, I'm always excited to discuss pedagogy, so send me an email!</p><br><br>

                    <h3>Research Interests</h3>
                    <h5 class="text-muted"> For the expert</h5>
                    <p> Geometric group theory is a field which aims to study infinite, finitely generated groups as geometric objects using tools from geometry, topology, and dynamics.  Much of my past and present research has focused on outer automorphisms of free groups.  Specifically, the extent to which they can be understood through analogies with mapping class groups of finite type surfaces.  Current, past, and future projects can be found below, on my CV, and on my research statement.</p>

                    <p> In a rather different direction, I've recently been learning some commutative algebra &amp; algebraic geometry.  In work with Adam Boocher, we used Boij-Soederberg theory to find strong lower bounds for the Betti numbers of modules over a polynomial ring that have small regularity relative to the minimal degree of a first syzygy.</p>

                    <p> Electronic copies of my papers are linked below.</p>

                    <p>  Here is my academic <a href="CV.pdf">curriculum vitae</a>. </p>

                    <h5 class="text-muted"> For the novice</h5>
                    <p> My research lies at the intersection of geometry and algebra.  A geometric group theorist aims to understand algebraic objects, called groups, via their interactions with geometric objects (spaces).  My favorite group is called $Out(F_n)$: the outer automorphism group of the free group $F_n$.  To learn about $Out(F_n)$, we need one (or many) spaces that this group interacts with.  There is a close relationship between $F_n$ and graphs (see picture), which gives rise to an action of $Out(F_n)$ on the space of all such graphs...outer space.  By studying/understanding outer space (not the one up in the sky) and the way that $Out(F_n)$ acts on it, we can learn about the group I like so much.  Much of the current understanding of $Out(F_n)$ comes from drawing analogies with better understood groups like the mapping class group, or the modular group.  There are also close ties between these groups and hyperbolic geometry.</p>

                    <h4>Woodworking</h4>
                    <p>In the past couple years I've gotten into woodworking.  I am still a novice, and would like to learn to work with more raw materials.  A variety of projects are shown here.  Though not purely woodworking, my largest project to date has been building a camper van.  I really enjoyed the whole process from start to finish.  It tested my patience, my problem solving abilities, and I learned a ton about design, DC electric systems, water systems, propane, solar power, cabinetry, etc.</p>
